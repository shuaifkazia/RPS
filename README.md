## API Documentation

For easy reference, the API is incorporated with Swagger to build beautiful and interactive API documentation. To access the Swagger documentation, use the endpoint:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/doc/
```

Note: All the API endpoints have been integrated with token authentication. Before using any API endpoint, log in and obtain the token. Then include it in the header section of the request as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
